OpenCards
=========

Open and adaptable client-server system for social card games.

This project is a suite of programs designed to provide a modular, adaptable, and purely OOP system for playing social card games with friends over the Internet.
The suite includes a client, server software, and a simple editor for creating new decks of cards.

The design principles are as follows:

- Provide a dynamic, intuitive interface
- Keep the code modular and adaptable
- Implement a pure OOP methodology by modeling a real-life situation directly
